# Masterji_Assignment_3_Js

Deployment link: https://random-quote-generator-by-vedant.netlify.app/

In this project I have implemented a project where a random quote gets generated on a click of the new quote button.
On the click of the copy button the quote gets copied to the clipboard.
There is a share on twitter button which when clicked redirects you to your twitter account with the random quote already pasted in the text.
I have also generated a random image behind the quote which was done with the help of  Math.random().
